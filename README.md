# Budgeter
Hello! 

This is my little hobby project. Budgeter is a software that you can use to manage your income and expenses. Open-source!

## Budgeting method
The budgeting method used by this software is the 50/30/20 -method.
This means that a maximum of 50% of your income should go towards your basics, 30% towards to your other expenses, and 20% to your savings.
More detailed explanations of this method can be found from the internet :)
